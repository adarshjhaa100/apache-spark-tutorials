Spark sql: Structured Data

## Interaction with SQL

    # Raw SQL
    # Dataset API
    

## Creating type for Datasets:

Suppose we have a dataset in a file and we want to type check that dataset using a custom class

class DataClass{
    param list in the database with their datatype
}

...

to load the file while checking the data, do this:

    spark.read.json(..).as[DataClass]
